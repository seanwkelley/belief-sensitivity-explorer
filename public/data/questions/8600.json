  "reasoning": "Given the positive clinical trial results for oral semaglutide, the current regulatory environment favoring innovative treatments for significant public health issues like obesity, and the ongoing trends in the pharmaceutical industry towards more effective obesity treatments, the likelihood of oral semaglutide being approved by the FDA or EMA by 2027 is high. The presence of public health need and relatively less competition in providing highly effective obesity treatments further supports this forecast.",
