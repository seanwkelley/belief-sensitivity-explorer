  "reasoning": "The probability of a first-time winner in the 2026 FIFA World Cup is influenced by a complex array of factors, including team investment, player talent, coaching quality, tournament experience, team chemistry, and the overall level of competition. While increased investment and skilled players can certainly contribute to a team's success, the experience and cohesion of the team, as well as the level of competition, also play significant roles. Given the historical dominance of established teams and the challenges faced by new teams in major tournaments, the probability of a first-time winner is relatively low, but not impossible.",
